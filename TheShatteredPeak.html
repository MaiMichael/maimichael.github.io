										<h3 class="major">What is The Shattered Peak?</h3>
										<p>The Shattered Peak is a survival horror game driven by narrative where you must surivive in a freezing cold environment chased by a dangerous entity to uncover the truth behind the mysterious events on a mysterious island.</p>

										<p>In The Shattered Peak you need to manage your body temperature and traverse dangerous zones guarded by a monstrous 
										creature that will hunt you. In the wilderness you can find tools for survival and collect wood to light up campfires and warm yourself up.</p>
										<p>Survival systems are seamlessly integrated with dialogues blended with the environment taking insipiration from Giant Sparrow's "What Remains of Edith Finch" in order to deliver narrative and give direction to players.
										Narrative elements can also be found scattered throughout the island as letters and pages. </p>

										<p>The game features diegetic UI and experience-oriented audio design to grant immersion in the atmosphere and the environment.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Project Description</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Roles:</b> Lead Designer/Project Manager </li>
										<li><b>Team size:</b> 10 people</li>
										<li><b>Duration:</b> June 2024 - October 2024</li>
									</ul>
									<h3 class="major">Ideation and Prototype Process</h3>
									<h4>Ideation</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Ideation_FinalConcept.png" alt="" /></span>For the ideation phase, I analysed survival games to outline the aesthetics that the genre must evoke in the player coming up with a list of possible aesthetics and dynamics. Some examples are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Sense of urgency</li>
										<li>Scarcity</li>
										<li>Being on the brink of failure</li>
										<li>Loneliness</li>
										<li>Tension</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I then organised the <b>Ideation meeting</b> by dividing it into 3 phases: Diverging, Discussion and Converging.
										<ul>
											<li>In the <b>Diverging phase</b>, all team members were invited to propose ideas without any constraints, with the aim of producing as many diverse ideas as possible. </li>
											<li>In the <b>Discussion phase</b>, I introduced constraints on those systems and dynamics that would lead to design scope problems (e.g. close combat, branching progression/narrative, intricate AI systems) and the team was invited to discuss the ideas, highlighting a preferred and a less preferred elements.</li>
											<li>In the <b>Converging phase</b>, the team formulated a concept based on what was discussed in the Discussion phase coming up with a <b>concept</b>.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<p>I then refined the concept in a game idea and with the team identified the systems to be developed and assigned a priority for the prototype to each one, giving importance to the new key systems we wanted to include.</p>
									<h4>Prototype</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/PrototypeMap.png" alt="" /></span>During this phase I focused on creating the <a href="files/ProjectWinter - Pitch PresentationProject.pdf"><b>Pitch presentation</b></a> and on laying down the GDD (<a href="files/ProjectWinter_GDD.pdf">read the full old version</a>) structure on Confluence while overseeing the whole prototype development, giving assistance and design direction to other developers.</p>
									<p>I organised test rounds on the prototype, collected and analysed players feedback which I then refined into a short <a href="files/ProjectWinter - Feedback Analysis.pdf"><b>Feedback Analysis document</b></a> that I presented to the rest of the team. 
										This approach allowed us to identify weaknesses early in the prototype and respond promptly by revising the concept and the systems involved and creating a more fun and engaging game loop.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Development Process</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/TSP_Screenshot1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Following some of the suggestions made in the feedback document and other solutions found after further analysis and research, <b>I modified the concept</b>, creating a more solid concept that would <b>solve the problems</b> found in the prototype.</p>

									<p>As lead designer and project manager I had the complete framework for project refactoring and development and <b>assigned priorities and tasks</b> to team members.</p>

									<p>During the development period, I supervised every part of the development, helping and/or taking charge of tasks including:
										<ul>
											<li>Map layout, overall progression and pacing of the game;</li>
											<li>Level design of the initial areas of the game;</li>
											<li>Heavy testing of each part of the game to keep polishing the core design;</li>
											<li>Filling the game design document;</li>
											<li>UI and Menus design</li>
											<li>The whole final polish of the game (light positioning, material creation, light functions, dialogues positioning, SFX and Audio)</li>
										</ul> 
									</p>

									<p>Following I will explain some of the processes behind the Map layout and testing. <b>Please watch the gameplay trailer at the top of the page to have more insights on the project</b>.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Map Layout and Progression of the game</h3>
									<p>The new concept changed the use of objects by tying progression to the finding of objects that allow the player to progress metroidvania-style. </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/TSP_ProtoMap.png" alt="" /></span>Progression was meant to:
										<ul>
											<li>Direct players without putting them on tracks;</li>
											<li>Leave breadcrumbs to the players to determine the correct path on their own;</li>
											<li>Limiting exploration through the use of skills and objects;</li>
											<li>Reduce to a minimum the backtracking.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<p>To achieve this effects we divided the whole map in <b>areas</b> where the player was free to <b>explore, find resources to survive, narrative elements and key items</b> to progress outside those areas.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/TSP_Map.png" alt="" /></span> We designed those areas with <b>landmarks</b> and peculiar elements to make them unique from one another, and placed key items in each area to determine progression.</p>
									<p>We then assigned a red number to each area to identify the <b>creature level of aggression</b> (higher number higher aggression)</p>
									<p>With all those elements placed I proceeded to implement them in Unreal using landscapes, landscape materials, and various asset packs.</p>
									<p>Following the final map layout that the player can found in the game with sites of interest and memorable landmarks. </p>

									<br>

									<h3 class="major">Testing</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Woods_Compass_Small.png" alt="" /></span>After the development of a satisfying version of the game that could return good feedback from players, 
										I organised a new <b>test round</b> including players who had played the prototype version (now far removed from the current version) and players new to the game.</p>
									<p>By collecting feedback and analysing the players as they played, I produced a new <b>feedback document</b> to illustrate the project achievements and failures. Read the document  <a href="files/ProjectWinter - Feedback Analysis 2.pdf.pdf"><b>HERE</b></a>.</p>
									<p>The analysis and document produced allowed me to draw up a backlog of tasks that allowed our team to give the game a final stir before release, fixing some weak points and creating a more solid product.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusions</h3>
									<p>
										In conclusion, all I have reported here is a small part of my contribution to the project. 
										The game is not where we hoped it would be, but it is still a finished and complete product. I am proud of myself and my team for having achieved this victory given the countless obstacles we faced.
