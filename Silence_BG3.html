										<!--
										<p>The Shattered Peak is a survival horror game driven by narrative where players must surivive in a freezing cold environment chased by a dangerous entity to uncover the truth behind the mysterious events on a desolated island.</p>

										<p>In the wilderness players can find tools for survival, wood to light up campfires and warm themselves up, letters and pages to put the story toghether.</p>
										<p>Survival systems are seamlessly integrated with dialogues blended with the environment taking insipiration from Giant Sparrow's "What Remains of Edith Finch" in order to deliver narrative and give direction to players.</p>

										<p>The game features diegetic UI and experience-oriented audio design to grant immersion in the atmosphere and the environment.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Project Description</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Roles:</b> Game Designer/Project Manager </li>
										<li><b>Team size:</b> 10 people</li>
										<li><b>Duration:</b> June 2024 - October 2024</li>
									</ul>
									<h3 class="major">Ideation and Prototype Process</h3>
									<h4>Ideation</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Ideation_FinalConcept.png" alt="" /></span>I analysed survival games to outline the aesthetics that the genre must evoke in the player coming up with a list of possible aesthetics and dynamics. Some examples are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Sense of urgency</li>
										<li>Scarcity</li>
										<li>Being on the brink of failure</li>
										<li>Loneliness</li>
										<li>Tension</li>
									</ul>
										
									<p>I then organised the <b>Ideation meeting</b> by dividing it into 3 phases: Diverging, Discussion and Converging.
										<ul>
											<li>In the <b>Diverging phase</b>, all team members were invited to propose ideas without any constraints, with the aim of producing as many diverse ideas as possible. </li>
											<li>In the <b>Discussion phase</b>, I introduced constraints on those systems and dynamics that would lead to design scope problems (e.g. close combat, branching progression/narrative, intricate AI systems) and the team was invited to discuss the ideas, highlighting a preferred and a less preferred elements.</li>
											<li>In the <b>Converging phase</b>, the team formulated a concept based on what was discussed in the Discussion phase coming up with a <b>concept</b>.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<p>I then refined the concept in a game idea and with the team identified the systems to be developed and assigned a priority for the prototype to each one, giving importance to the new key systems we wanted to include.</p>
									<h4>Prototype</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/PrototypeMap.png" alt="" /></span>During this phase I focused on creating the <a href="files/ProjectWinter - Pitch PresentationProject.pdf"><b>Pitch presentation</b></a> and on laying down the GDD (<a href="files/ProjectWinter_GDD.pdf">read the full old version</a>) structure on Confluence while overseeing the whole prototype development, giving assistance and design direction to other developers.</p>
									<p>I organised test rounds on the prototype, collected and analysed players feedback which I then refined into a short <a href="files/ProjectWinter - Feedback Analysis.pdf"><b>Feedback Analysis document</b></a> that I presented to the rest of the team. 
										This approach allowed us to identify weaknesses early in the prototype and respond promptly by revising the concept and the systems involved and creating a more fun and engaging game loop.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Development Process</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/TSP_Screenshot1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Following some of the suggestions made in the feedback document and other solutions found after further analysis and research, <b>I modified the concept</b>, creating a more solid concept that would <b>solve the problems</b> found in the prototype.</p>

									<p>During the development period, my tasks included:
										<ul>
											<li>Design map layout, overall progression and pacing of the game;</li>
											<li>Level design of game's areas including ;</li>
											<li>Heavy testing of each part of the game to keep polishing the core design;</li>
											<li>Filling the game design document;</li>
											<li>UI and Menus design</li>
											<li>The whole final polish of the game (light positioning, material creation, light functions, dialogues positioning, SFX and Audio)</li>
										</ul> 
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Map Layout and Progression of the game</h3>
									<p>Progression was tied to the finding objects that allow the player to progress through areas in metroidvania-style. </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/TSP_ProtoMap.png" alt="" /></span> Progression was meant to:
										<ul>
											<li>Direct players without putting them on tracks;</li>
											<li>Leave breadcrumbs for players to determine the critical path on their own;</li>
											<li>Limiting exploration through the use of skills and objects;</li>
											<li>Reduce the backtracking to a minimum.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<h4>Challenge 1</h4>
									<p>We wanted to create a world that could give the illusion of open world but heavily direct players to avoid the extreme challenges that an open world could create.</p>
									<p>And subsequently increase the challenge that each area put on the player.</p>

									<h4>Solution</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>We divided the whole map in <b>areas</b> where the player was free to <b>explore, find resources to survive, find narrative elements and key items</b> to progress outside those areas.</li>
										<li>We designed those areas with <b>landmarks</b> and peculiar elements to make them unique from one another, and placed key items in each area to determine progression.</li>
										<li>Created an extreme environment in darkness to push player towards a more conservative and safe playstyle.</li>
										<li>Assigned a red number to each area to identify the <b>creature level of aggression</b> (higher number higher aggression) increasing difficulty as the number goes up.</li>
										<li>Introduced the compass as one of the first items in the game.</li>
									</ul>

										</div>
									</div>
									
									<h4>Challenge 2</h4>
									<p>In total darkness players still felt lost even with the flashlight due to the open nature of the environment.</p>

									<h4>Solution</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Used our dialogue system as points of relief during area exploration and tell the players they were going in the right direction.</li>
										<li>Placed strategic lighting to direct players towards points of interests an orient themselves.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Testing</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Woods_Compass_Small.png" alt="" /></span>After the development of a satisfying version of the game that could return good feedback from players, 
										I organised a new <b>test round</b> including players who had played the prototype version (now far removed from the current version) and players new to the game.</p>
									<p>By collecting feedback and analysing the players as they played, I produced a new <b>feedback document</b> to illustrate the project achievements and failures. Read the document  <a href="files/ProjectWinter - Feedback Analysis 2.pdf.pdf"><b>HERE</b></a>.</p>
